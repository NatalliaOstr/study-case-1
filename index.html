                    Marilyn Monroe (June 1, 1926 – August 5, 1962) was an American model and actress. One of the most
                    popular sex symbols of the 1950s, she played stereotypically "dumb blonde" characters that were
                    emblematic of the era's attitudes towards sexuality. She began her career as a pin-up model.
                    After two short-lived film contracts, she was signed by 20th Century-Fox in 1951. The next year,
                    scandalous nude photographs of her were featured in a popular calendar. She became one of the most
                    bankable Hollywood stars with starring roles in comedies such as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953),
                    How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), and The Seven Year Itch (1955). Disappointed in being typecast
                    and underpaid, Monroe formed her own production company in 1955 and successfully fought for a better
                    contract with Fox

                    The arts is a vast subdivision of culture, composed of many creative endeavors and disciplines. It
                    is a broader term than "art", which, as a description of a field, usually means only the visual arts
                    . The arts encompass the visual arts, the literary arts and the performing arts – music, theatre,
                    dance and film, among others. This list is by no means comprehensive, but only meant to introduce
                    the concept of the arts. For all intents and purposes, the history of the arts begins with the
                    history of art. The arts might have origins in early human evolutionary prehistory.

                    <p>Ancient Greek art saw the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills
                        to show musculature, poise, beauty and anatomically correct proportions. Ancient Roman art
                        depicted gods as idealized humans, shown with characteristic distinguishing features (e.g.
                        Jupiter's thunderbolt).
